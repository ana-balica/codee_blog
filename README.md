Install
--------
To run the app on your local machine, do the following:

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install the dependencies based on `requirements.txt`. Basically many of the dependencies are redundant for a local-machine run. \#TODO Create a setup/build script for installation.
4. Run `python runserver`
